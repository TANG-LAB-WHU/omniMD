# Training se_e2_a on the GPU runtime

`omnimd-native-gpu-train` trains a native se_e2_a model of any network size on
one NVIDIA GPU, with DeePMD-kit's `ener` loss, learning-rate schedule and Adam
settings. It is separate from the bounded CPU/CUDA trainers behind
`omnimd-mlmd train-native`, which are limited to small networks.

Build (same runtime requirements as [guide step 28](../GETTING_STARTED.md#28-run-se_e2_a-on-the-gpu-runtime-and-compute-dataset-statistics)):

```sh
cargo build --release --locked --manifest-path mlmd/Cargo.toml -p omnimd-native --features gpu --bin omnimd-native-gpu-train

- `model` is either the `model` section of a DeePMD input script, as above, or
  the path of an existing native model to continue from (for example one
  converted with `tools/convert_deepmd.py`).
- `dataset` is an omnimd-dataset-jsonl-v1 file (`omnimd-mlmd import-deepmd`, or
  `bench/hap_prepare.py` for DeePMD npy systems). Every frame needs energy and
  force labels; virial labels are used where present.
- `learning_rate`, `loss` and `training` take the DeePMD keys shown, with
  DeePMD's defaults for the loss prefactors and `decay_steps`. Unknown keys are
  rejected.
- `precision` is the network precision, `float64` (default) or `float32`.
  Geometry, forces, virial and the loss are float64 either way.
- `training.save_freq` (optional) writes a snapshot every that many steps:
  `<output>.step-N`, the model, and `<output>.step-N.adam`, the optimizer state.
- `output`, `disp_file` and snapshot files must not exist; nothing is overwritten.

To continue a stopped run, give the snapshot as `model` and its `.adam` file as
`training.optimizer_state`, keep the other settings, and choose new `output` and
`disp_file` names. The run resumes at the snapshot's step with the same
schedule and Adam state. Its frame order is drawn afresh, so it is not
identical to the uninterrupted run.

## What happens

**A fresh model.** With a `model` section the networks are drawn like
DeePMD-kit's PyTorch backend does: weights normal with standard deviation
`1/sqrt(inputs + outputs)`, biases standard normal, timesteps normal around 0.1.
A hidden layer is residual when it keeps or doubles its width. The random stream
is omniMD's own, so a seed does not reproduce DeePMD's numbers. From the dataset
the trainer computes, with DeePMD's definitions ([`stats`](src/stats.rs)):

- `sel`, when given as `"auto"` or `"auto:FACTOR"`, from the neighbor statistics;
- the descriptor normalization `davg`/`dstd`, over all frames;
- the per-type energy bias, by minimum-norm least squares.

DeePMD samples a few batches per system for these statistics; using every frame
gives slightly different numbers.

**Loss.** For a frame of `N` atoms, with prefactors `p_e`, `p_f`, `p_v`:

```text
L = p_e (E - E*)^2 / N + p_f mean((F - F*)^2) + p_v mean((V - V*)^2) / N
```

and the batch loss is the mean over its frames. Each prefactor moves from its
`start_` to its `limit_` value in proportion to the learning rate:
`p = limit + (start - limit) * lr / start_lr`. A frame without a virial label
contributes no virial term.

**Learning rate.** Stepped exponential decay as DeePMD's `LearningRateExp`:
`lr(step) = max(start_lr * r^floor(step / decay_steps), stop_lr)` with
`r = (stop_lr / start_lr)^(decay_steps / numb_steps)`. A `decay_steps` no shorter
than the run is replaced as DeePMD does. The values are pinned to DeePMD-kit
3.1.3 in the unit tests.

**Optimizer.** Adam with `torch.optim.Adam`'s defaults (betas 0.9 and 0.999,
epsilon 1e-8, no weight decay), one update per batch. Trainable are all weights,
biases and timesteps of the embedding and fitting networks; normalization and
energy bias stay fixed.

**Gradient.** Forces and virial are derivatives of the energy, so the gradient
of their loss terms needs second-order information. With `a = dL/dE`,
`c = dL/dF` and `w = dL/dV` held fixed, the loss gradient equals the gradient of
`a*E - E'`, where `E'` is the directional derivative of the energy when every
neighbor vector `d = r_j - r_i` moves along `c_j - c_i + w^T d`. One forward
pass carries that tangent through the environment matrix, the embedding nets,
the descriptor and the fitting nets, and one reverse pass through both gives
the gradient (`omnimd_gpu::TrainNetwork`, [`gpu_train.rs`](src/gpu_train.rs)).

**Frame order.** Frames are visited in shuffled epochs from `training.seed`.
With `batch_size` 1 this samples systems in proportion to their frame counts,
like DeePMD's default `prob_sys_size`.

## Output

- `output`: the trained native model, usable by `omnimd-native-gpu-eval`,
  `omnimd-native-eval` and the engine.
- `disp_file`: one line every `disp_freq` steps with the step, the energy RMSE
  per atom, the force RMSE and the virial RMSE per atom of that batch, and the
  learning rate. These are DeePMD's `rmse_e_trn`, `rmse_f_trn` and `rmse_v_trn`.
- Standard output: one JSON object with the step count, time and steps per
  second.

## Limits

- One GPU, one frame at a time: a frame and its recorded intermediates must fit
  in device memory (frames of a few hundred atoms need well under 1 GB).
- se_e2_a with one embedding net per type pair (`type_one_side: false`), tanh
  activations and an energy fitting net. No hybrid descriptors, type embedding,
  fparam/aparam, atomic energies or force-only prefactors (`pref_pf`, `pref_gf`).
- No validation set during training. Without `save_freq` a run that stops
  leaves no model.
- No fine-tuning controls (frozen layers, bias adjustment).
- Each step issues several hundred small device launches, so the time per step
  depends little on the frame size for small frames.

## How it was checked

- The trainer's prediction and loss equal the inference path
  (`tests/gpu_train.rs`).
- The gradient matches central finite differences of the loss for the energy,
  force and virial terms separately and together, on every 37th of about 7,000
  parameters of a two-type model with both residual kinds and timesteps.
- Batches average their frames; Adam matches a host implementation of
  `torch.optim.Adam`'s rule; a student network fits a teacher's labels in both
  precisions.
- A run continued from an exported model and its optimizer state reaches the
  same parameters as the uninterrupted run (to 1e-11); without the optimizer
  state it does not.
- Removing the second-derivative term, transposing the virial direction or
  dropping either descriptor adjoint term makes the gradient test fail.
